# 30 Days of Leetcode

Welcome to my 30 Days of Leetcode challenge repository!

This repository contains my solutions to the "30 Days of Leetcode" challenge, where I aim to solve one Leetcode problem every day for 30 days. The goals of this challenge are to improve my problem-solving skills, learn new algorithms and data structures, and document my progress.

## Structure

- Each solution will be organized in folders by day (e.g., `Day01`, `Day02`, ...).
- Every solution includes the original problem link, my approach, and code (usually in Python, but sometimes in other languages).
- Additional notes or learning reflections may be included for each day/problem.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse the daily folders and review the code and explanations. You can use the content for reference, learning, or inspiration for your own Leetcode practice!

## Why 30 Days?

Consistent practice is one of the keys to mastering coding interviews and algorithmic thinking. This challenge helps build discipline and track progress over a focused period.

Happy coding!
